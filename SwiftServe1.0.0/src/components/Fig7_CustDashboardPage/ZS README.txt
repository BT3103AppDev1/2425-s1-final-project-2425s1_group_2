are you changing anything in this directory? then this message is for you

#1: javier has deprecated everyfile except:
    CustOrders.vue
    .js files
    .png files (for testing)
    order is basically .vue file handles frontend (labour is centred around html and css
    for readability), .js handles backend, auth,
    preprocessing data
    (DO NOT DELETE ANYTHING YET UNTIL IT IS STABLE :c comment it out instead)
    (DO NOT PUSH TO MAIN UNTIL IT IS STABLE)

#2: see format in .js files, do the auth stuff, get me in that exact format, things should
run

#3: if you wanna do unit test, split it into testing front end 
        aka i give u the json and u check for robustness 
        and split it to backend, aka i give you a person you can retrieve his data

#4: once #3 can be done, do integration test with the combination of backend test + front
    end test
