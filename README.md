Hawker centres form an integral part of Singaporean culture, with individuals from all walks of life patronising them for affordable and convenient access to a diverse set of local delights (NHB, 2021). Yet, hawker centres continue to face stresses with coping with overcrowding and seating availability (MSE, 2021). Customers often experience waiting times of over 90 minutes for meals and seating, especially during peak dining periods and near popular hawker stalls (TimeOut, 2020). The once joyful experience of dining out has become a stressful ordeal.

SwiftServe aims to bring the joy of dining back to hawker centres. By eliminating the stress of waiting and queuing, everyone can better savour their meal and connect with the hawker culture. SwiftServe brings together Customers and Merchants to form a creative platform, aimed at revolutionising how Customers queue and gain access to seats at hawker centres. It integrates queue-management as well as time-based seat-allocation, allowing Customers to place hawker meal orders ahead of time whilst guaranteeing seats during meal crowds. By decreasing time spent waiting and searching for seats, SwiftServe aims to decrease operational bottlenecks and improve the Customer experience.

Our platform is designed to cater to a diverse spread of Customers. These include working adults and tech-savvy youth who wish to utilise innovative solutions for efficient meal breaks. SwiftServe allows Customers to sign up and locate the Hawker centre of choice, place meal orders and reserve seats. Customers will also be informed of seat availability through the website application.

We aim to work closely with hawker centres and Merchants for platform buy-in, so as to work towards the collective goal of a joyful hawker centre experience for Customers. Our first target hawker centre, Yuhua Village Market and Food Centre has little digitalisation, which makes it suitable to test the effectiveness and adaptability of our platform. The successful creation of the SwiftServe platform demonstrates our dedication to transform the future of hawker culture as one centred around continuous innovation and efficiency. 

SwiftServe believes that there will be a day where we can associate hawker centres with convenience, efficiency and an exceptional dining experience. We invite Customers and Merchants who want to reignite and enjoy the hawker culture that we all know and love. Together, we can keep this tradition going forward and showcase the definitive hawker experience.
