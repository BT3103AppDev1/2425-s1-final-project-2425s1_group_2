## About
Hawker centres form an integral part of Singaporean culture, with individuals from all walks of life patronising them for affordable and convenient access to a diverse set of local delights. Yet, hawker centres continue to face stresses with coping with overcrowding and seating availability. Customers often experience waiting times of over 90 minutes for meals and seating, especially during peak dining periods and near popular hawker stalls. The once joyful experience of dining out has become a stressful ordeal.

_Swiftserve_ aims to bring the joy of dining back to hawker centres. By eliminating the stress of waiting and queuing, everyone can better savour their meal and connect with the hawker culture. _Swiftserve_ brings together Customers and Merchants to form a creative platform, aimed at revolutionising how Customers queue and gain access to seats at hawker centres. It integrates queue-management as well as time-based seat-allocation, allowing Customers to place hawker meal orders ahead of time whilst guaranteeing seats during meal crowds. By decreasing time spent waiting and searching for seats, _Swiftserve_ aims to decrease operational bottlenecks and improve the Customer experience.

Our platform is designed to cater to a diverse spread of Customers. These include working adults and tech-savvy youth who wish to utilise innovative solutions for efficient meal breaks. _Swiftserve_ allows Customers to sign up and locate the Hawker centre of choice, place meal orders and reserve seats. Customers will also be informed of seat availability through the website application.

Following the SCRUM framework and two sprints, we completed all 39 user stories in our Product Backlog. We carried out the SCRUM steps of Sprint planning, biweekly stand-ups, Sprint reviews and retrospectives. Google Sheets was utilised to keep a count on the progress of our Product Backlog as well as to keep track of our Sprint burndown and completion rates. Github was utilised to allow for parallel development of our web application by our SCRUM Team.

The successful development and deployment of _Swiftserve_ reinforces our belief that there will be a day where we can associate hawker centres with convenience, efficiency and an exceptional dining experience. We invite Customers and Merchants who want to reignite and enjoy the hawker culture that we all know and love. Together, we can keep this tradition going forward and showcase the definitive hawker experience.
